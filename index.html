            My name is Michael Odya. I am a Computer and Data Science major. 
            I took two classes over the summer. One being L I S 416 (I think) 
            for the data science major and the other being CS 579 which is a virutal reality class.
            This virtual reality class allowed me to work with a medium that I 
            have only experienced a handful of times in my life and that I have not touched for years. 
            It awakened an interest in game development within me and I would consider it one of my hobbies, 
            along with going to the gym and doing various activites and sports with friends.
            I hope to be able to find a job I am interested in when I graduate, 
            but I also hope I will be able to create somehting, likely some sort of a game, that thousands can enjoy!
